# Visual Analytics Project - Human Resources Consultancy
This project is a web app that provides data analysis and salary prediction for software developers based on the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey. The project consists of two main parts:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation, and machine learning modeling on the survey data.

- A **Streamlit app** that allows users to interactively explore the data and get salary predictions based on country, education, and experience.

## Features
The web app has the following features:

* **Dashboard:** Shows the distribution of software developers by country, experience, and salary range and contains many diverse EDA visualizations.
* **Interactive Maps:** Two maps display the mean salary and the number of developers for each country.
* **Prediction Tools:**
  - Estimates the salary of a software developer based on their country, education, and experience.
  - Estimates the salary of a software developer based on multiple features.
* **Comparison Tool:** Shows the salary difference between two countries for a given education and experience level and provides more information about your predictions.
